## Maze Mapping using an Omnidirectional Mobile Robot (OMR)

Using an Omnidirectional Mobile Robot developed navigation algorithms so that the 
robot would be able to avoid obstacles across a Maze until it finds a specific target. 
For this project those targets were 3 soda cans. Once the robot found them, it would 
use its robotic arm to reach for one of those cans and take it back to the starting position.
