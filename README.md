## Cyber Physical Systems (CPS)
The Cyber Physical Systems are a combination of phyisical systems which 
perform some kind of process or function, and the digital twins that model 
their behavior. During my seventh semester I took this concentration, and 
I got to work on disciplines such as precision design, artificial intelligence, 
advanced control, robotics, additive manufacturing and advanced computational 
modeling. This repository contains the algorithms used to 


### Projects
The projects I developed during this semester were:
* Maze Mapping using an Omnidirectional Mobile Robot
    * Using an Omnidirectional Mobile Robot developed navigation algorithms so that
      the robot would be able to avoid obstacles across a Maze until it finds a specific
      target. For this project those targets were 3 soda cans. Once the robot found them,
      it would use its robotic arm to reach for one of those cans and take it back to the
      starting position.
      
    * Sensors: Camera, LiDAR,
    * Algorithms: 
* Control over 2 Omnidirectional Mobile Robots
    *
