## Differential Mobile Robot (DMR)

This type of mobile robot uses two separately driven wheels placed on either side of the robot's body. This type of configuration allows the robot to change directions without the need of an additional steering mechanism. 

The components used for this project were:
* Jetson NVIDIA with Ubuntu 18.04 as OS
* Raspberry PI wide angle camera 

The topics involved in this project are:
* kinematics
* dynamics
* artificial vision
* neural networks
